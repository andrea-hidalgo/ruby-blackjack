Commands to Set up Your own repo: 

<h4>git branch</h4>   
   lists all branches 
<h4>git branch new_branch</h4>
   creates a new branch
<h4>git checkout branch_name</h4>
   switches to that branch
<h4>git checkout -b new_branch_name</h4>
   creates a new branch and immediately switches to that branch
<h4>git diff</h4>
   lets you see the changes you've made BEFORE git add

<h2>Okay, so now you've made some changes on your working branch. Here's what happens next...</h2>

<h4>git status</h4>
always good to have a check in and see where you're at
<h4>git add -A</h4>
stage all your changes
<h4>git commit -m "added suits to the cards"</h4>
after each accomplishment, commit 
<h4>git push origin dev</h4>
you push from the branch you are working on in your computer....so dev, or kevin, or allegra...you are pushing the changes from the branch you are working on to your github- the matching branch
<h4></h4>

<h2>Now Navigate to your OWN github repo..</h2>

<p>Pull down the branch from the drop down you just pushed your changes to. Once you are there, you should hopefully be able to make a pull request and pull your changes in to your own repo branch.</p>
